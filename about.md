## About

This course offers an introduction to advanced topics in statistics with the focus of understanding the kind of data we see in the behavioral and social sciences. The aim is for statistical concepts to be tightly interwoven with the practice of psychological research, where we build models and work with data in R. The centerpiece of the course is to achieve a deep understanding of the linear mixed-effects model, which we will approach from both a frequentist and Bayesian perspective. Along the way, other topics will be visited (and revisited), including notions of power, measurement, non-parametric statistics, and model comparison.

## Course Requirements and Grades: 

Course requirements include regular attendance, active participation in class discussions and weekly labs, and completion of all exams and homework assignments. There will be two closed-book exams completed in class to assess conceptual knowledge, as well as 14 homework assignments, which will involve hands-on application of the material. These assignments are issued Wednesday afternoon and are due the following Wednesday morning at 8:00 am. Eleven of these assignments are relatively short "weekly homework assignments," graded on a pass/fail basis; three of these assignments are longer "comprehensive homework assignments," graded on a percentage scale. These components are assigned the following weights:

* 45%: Comprehensive homeworks
* 20%: Weekly homeworks 
* 30%: In-class exams
* 5%: Participation

And course grades are assigned as follows: A = 92- 100%, AB = 88-92%, B = 82-88%, BC = 78-82%, C = 78% and below:

## Resources

Our course notes are available online [here](https://socialinteractionlab.github.io/psych710-notes/).
For many classes, there will be assigned readings and/or accompanying online interactive tutorials link in the [schedule](/schedule). There is no official course textbook, although much of the presentation is loosely sourced from Gelman & Hill's *[Data analysis using regression and multilevel / hierarchical models](https://www.amazon.com/Analysis-Regression-Multilevel-Hierarchical-Models/dp/052168689X)* and McElreath's *[Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/)* which are regarded as gold standard for mixed-effects models and Bayesian data analysis, respectively. 

## Policies

Please familiarize yourself with the honor code. We will adhere to it and follow through on its penalty guidelines.

### When is the weekly homework due?

Each week, we will make the homework available on Wednesday afternoon after class. The homework is then due the following Wednesday by 8am.

### What if I turn my homework in late?

You will have 5 slip days in total. If you return a homework within 24h after the deadline, this costs you one slip day (or 2 slip days if you return it within 48h, etc.). If youâ€™ve use up all your slip days, late homework submissions from that point on will receive a score of 0.

### Can we work in groups?

You are encouraged to work and study in groups. However, your writeup must be your own (both the coding as well as any written text). You will indicate who you worked with on your writeup.

## Feedback

We welcome feedback regarding the course at any point! Please feel free to email us directly or come to office hours to discuss.
